# Runtime Exports

This directory houses static, authoritative JSON exports generated by the runtime. These files are intended for downstream consumers (such as the dashboard) to ingest without requiring live runtime dependencies.

- `changelog.json` provides runtime-scoped changelog entries that mirror the dashboard changelog schema for static consumption.
- Existing exports (clips, polls, tallies, scoreboards) remain unchanged and continue to serve as reference data snapshots.
