"""Lifecycle utilities placeholder for the Discord runtime.

This module will eventually provide lifecycle helpers (startup, shutdown,
health checks) specific to the Discord control-plane runtime while reusing
shared configuration and state primitives.

All logic is intentionally deferred to keep the scaffold lightweight until the
runtime is activated.
