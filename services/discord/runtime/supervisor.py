"""Placeholder supervisor for the Discord runtime.

Intended responsibilities:
- bootstrap the Discord control-plane runtime entrypoint
- manage command handlers, event routing, and background tasks for Discord
- coordinate logging, health reporting, and restartability separate from the
  streaming ingestion runtime

Implementation is intentionally omitted until the Discord runtime is fully
wired.
